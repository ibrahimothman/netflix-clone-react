## netflix-clone-react
A Netflix Clone using React and Firebase

This application was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context API), Firebase & Styled Components. I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse and the homepage. There are four different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.

I used compound components (just a design pattern) to build my component. The styling is all handled via styled components.
